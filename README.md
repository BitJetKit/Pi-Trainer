# Pi-Trainer
Train an AI to predict the mathematical constant, PI

Version 1.0
Progress: Transfer Data to Access database
*IMPORTANT STEP*
Create an Access 2016 or later Database of your choice in naming. Then, create a table of your naming with an ID (Primary Key, AutoNumber) and a column for the results (Number, Double, decimal places to a demand. I am selecting 'Auto').
Once the training data is available, I shall implement an AI that tests for the likely 1st digit, the 2nd digit, the 3rd digit, but even the 4th digit, etc.

You will need Python3 (or some Anaconda as it simplifies processes)
This originally ran on VS Code with the Python extension by Microsoft on Windows 10.
